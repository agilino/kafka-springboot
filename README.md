# Running Spring Boot with Kafka

This repository contains a small practice for running kafka with spring. We performed this exercise together with computer science students from Can Tho University on 26 Dez 2022.

Please to refer the Springboot project [here](./spring_kafka/).

This repository contains also a [docker-compose configuration](./kafka_server/) to run kafka wih reverse proxy on public cloud. DO NOT use that config on production, because anyone will be able to access your kafka server and your kafka topics.
